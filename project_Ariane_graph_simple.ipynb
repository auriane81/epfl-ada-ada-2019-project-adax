    "The very first idea coming to mind when one wants to improve people's consumption habits is to make them consume healthy products. The problem of this approach is the requirement of a \"healthiness score\" that is not easy to evaluate.\n",
    "A second approach would be to advise products that consumers usually like. Again, this will bring us to define an \"appreciation score\" reflecting how likely a consumer is to re-buy this product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# I - Healthiness score\n",
    "\n",
    "No information concerning the products' healthiness is provided in the datasets. By clustering the users according to their consumptions in each aisle, we can separate them into more or less healthy groups. Now, we define the healthiness of a production as a function of the distribution of people who consumed this product.\n",
    "For instance, if a \"healthy\" user consumes a certain product, it gives 4 points to this product. An \"average\" consumer would give 1 point, while an \"unhealthy\" consumer would remove 1 point to the product. Then, it is easy to adapt this (arbitrary) scores making a weighted average taking the number of consumptions into account. The bigger the score, the healthier the product.\n",
    "In particular, if a product has a score of -1, it means that it's only consumed by people of the unhealthy cluster, and a product rated 4 is only conumed by people of the healthy cluster.\n",
    "The healthiness score may be irrelevant when a product is only consumed by very few people, because it introduces a great variance in score evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II - Appreciation score\n",
    "\n",
    "We can decude from our dataset the average number of times a product is re-bought. Nevertheless, we have to take the consumer's consumption habits into account. For instance, imagine a consumer, Ada, buying everytime the same set of products, and bought each of them 10 times, except one product, let's say \"chicory and ham\", which wasn't so good, and she bought it only 4 times. Now imagine  a second consumer Robert, who doesn't like consuming the same products, and tries to have a very varied consumption. He bought once each product, except one, say \"goat cheese\", which he loved and bought 3 times. If Ada and Robert are the only consumers of the dataset, \"chicory and ham\" would have a better appreciation score (that is 4) than \"goat cheese\" (score of 3). We don't want this to happen ! \n",
    "This is why we normalize the contribution of each user by the average time he or she consumes each product. Then, we avarege the scores obtained for each user, and obtain a general appreciation score for the product. The greater, the more the product is likely to be re-bought. The score itself is difficult to  interpret, but we can compare different scores quite safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## III - Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some products have been consumed by very few people, sometimes 0, so we have no (reliable) information about their scores. A quick exploration of these products show that they are not products we would want to advise, because they are too specific. As an example, we can mention and . Our decision for these products is to give them a score of 0."
